childhood, Nick dealt not only with the typical challenges of school
and adolescence, such as bullying and self-esteem issues, he also

of “Why was I the one born without arms and legs?” out of his head.

his own. <mark>A janitor at his high school inspired him to start speaking publicly about overcoming
    adversity, so Nick starting speaking to small groups of students when he was 17.</p></mark>
